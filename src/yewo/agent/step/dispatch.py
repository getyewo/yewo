"""Sending one action to the device, and saying what it did.

Separated from the loop. It is the only place that touches the device, and
the only place that names what the attempt did afterwards. One attempt fills
four readers: the step record, the history the planner reads next, the
trail, and the replay ledger. They have to agree, so they are filled here
rather than at four call sites.

An action that raises is still an action that happened. The error is kept
and the screen is settled anyway. The stall policy is told as well: a step
that reached nothing stalls a screen as surely as one refused before
dispatch.
