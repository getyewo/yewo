"""`yewo lock` — write the suite a run will execute, with no device.

Generation needs the journey and a model. It does not need an emulator, an
app or a driver. So a separate command writes the lock, and leaves it to be
reviewed as a commit. A typo in a journey file then costs one model call
rather than a device boot.

Two jobs an ordinary run cannot do: lock with no device attached, and refresh
deliberately rather than as a side effect of testing.
